                     Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
                        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                        "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising 
                        pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
                        teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
                        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
                        know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
                        is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, 
                        but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
